                <p>Life is all about infusing our cultures with the cultures of others.<br/>We live in a society filled with a variety of cultures and people from many backgrounds, yet so many people are not aware of these cultures and how important they are. We cannot afford to ignore the importance of every single individual and the impact they make with their backgrounds on being a diverse community.<br/>The aim of FUSION is to celebrate and support diversity to all its extent, by funding events taking place at Universities across the UK. At FUSION, we believe that Universities are a good place to start this project, as they are filled with young individuals from different backgrounds, ready to embrace life, and become the future leaders of their generation.<br/> Our first funded event, the HOLI Festival, took place at Royal Holloway, University of London on Wednesday, 22nd of March, 2017. We collaborated with the University's Hindu Society and helped them fund this event, while providing our services of creating digital content to help spread the message.</p>
